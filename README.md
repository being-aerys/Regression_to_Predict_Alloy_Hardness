# Regression for Alloy's Hardness Property Prediction
We use several physical and compositional features of different alloys to predict the hardness. This work has a potential of eliminating alloy preparation time of several days and alloy preparation cost of several hundreds of dollars.

## Dependencies
This project requires python and the following python libraries.
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. seaborn
4. matplotlib
5. scikit-learn
6. skorch

It also requires a software that can open and execute a Jupyter Notebook.
