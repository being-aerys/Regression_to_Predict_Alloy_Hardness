# Regression for Alloy's Hardness Property Prediction
We use several physical and compositional features of different alloys to predict the hardness. This work has a potential of eliminating alloy preparation time of several days and alloy preparation cost of several hundreds of dollars. <br>

Following is a sample image of how loss reduces over time for one configuration of random hyperparameters search.
